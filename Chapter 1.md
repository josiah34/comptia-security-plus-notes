## Three Objectives of Cyber Security 
![cia](img/cia.png)
  

- Confidentiality 
- Availability
- Integrity 

Also known as the **CIA Triad** 

**Confidentiality** ensures unauthorized individuals are not able to gain access to sensitive information. 

**Integrity** ensures there are no unauthorized modifications to information or systems.

**Availability** ensures that information and systems are ready for use by legitimate users upon request. 


### Three main threats to cybersecurity (DAD Triad)
- Disclosure 
- Alteration 
- Denial 

Disclouse is the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users, otherwise known as data loss. Disclosure is a violation of the principle of confidentiality.

Alteration is the unauthorized modification of information and is a violation of the principle of integrity.

Denial is unitended disruption of an authorized user's legitimate access to information. This is a violation of the principle of availability.


### Breach Impact

A security incident's potential impact is assessed by using the cateogories businesses usually use to describe risk which are: 

- **Financial Risk**, the risk of monetary damage to the organization as the result of a data breach.  
- **Reputational Risk**, occurs when the negative publicity surrounding a security breach causes the loss of goodwill among customers, employees, suppliers and other stackholders.
- **Strategic Risk**, is the risk that an organization will become less effective in meeting its major goals and objectives as a result of the breach. 
- **Operational Risk**, is the risk to the organization's ability carry out its day-to-day functions. Very closely related to Strategic Risk, the difference is operational risk would only result in ineffiency and delay within an organization while Strategic risk might threaten the existence of an organization. 
- **Compliance Risk**, occurs when a security breach causes an organization to violate legal or regulatory requirements. 

### Security Controls 

As an organization analyzes its risk environment, technical and business leaders determine the level of protection required to preserve the condfidentiality, integrity and availability of their information and systems. They express these requirements by writing control objectives that the organization wishes to achieve. These are statements of a desired security state but they do not alone carry out security activities. 

**Security controls** are specific measures that fullfill the security objectives of an organization. 

There are three different categories of security controls:

- **Technical controls** enforce confidentiality, integrity and availability in digital spaces. Examples inlude access control lists, firewall rules and encryption. 

- **Operational controls** include the processes that we put in place to manage technology in a secure manner. These include user access reviews, log monitoring and vulnerability management. 
- **Managerial controls** are procedural mechanisims that focus on the mechanics of the risk management process. 65u75
